# SMS Spam Classifier using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using NLP techniques and supervised learning models.

## Features
- NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, cleaning)
- Model comparison: Naive Bayes, SVM
- Confusion matrix-based performance evaluation
- Prioritizes high precision to minimize false positives

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `Spam_Classifier.ipynb` to train and test the model
3. Run `app.py` using Streamlit to launch the web app
